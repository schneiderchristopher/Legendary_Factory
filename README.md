# Legendary Factory
## The ultimate Factorio Challenge

From the beginning, our goal is to build a factory to be Legendary. But what if, from the start, we were Legendary?
That’s exactly what **Legendary Factory** brings to the table—the ultimate challenge!

Features:
- You are only allowed to place **Legendary Entities**. (Except Belts, Burner Mining Drills, and other entities where quality doesn't make a difference.)
- A new **Quality Module**, to start your legendary adventure!
- **New machines**: Burner Assembler Machine and Burner Recycler.
- **Difficulties**: Choose your fate when starting your legendary factory!
